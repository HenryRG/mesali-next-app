This is a [Next.js] project.

This Project is created by me while I was doing a NextJS course. I made some changes to 
the final project, changes that are better to the user experince and to the "company".

It's a website created to connect users to restaurants. The main goal is 
make a reserve in the restaurant without call to them.


The design of this project was build with [Tailwind]
The database is build on [Postgres]

The database management system that is used is [Supabase]
